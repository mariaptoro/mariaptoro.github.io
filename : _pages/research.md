# Research

My research addresses ecological, evolutionary, and conservation questions in Neotropical amphibians and reptiles, with a particular emphasis on bioacoustics and biodiversity monitoring.

## Research interests
- Bioacoustics and passive acoustic monitoring  
- Amphibian ecology, behaviour, and natural history  
- Evolutionary biology and warning signals  
- Biological collections and biodiversity data  
- Human impacts on tropical ecosystems  

## Current and recent projects
- Environmental Sound Collection (CSA), Instituto Humboldt (2024–present)  
- CHORUS Project: Machine listening to monitor climate change impacts on Neotropical amphibians (2022–2023)  
- Programme Orquídeas – Science for Peace: impacts of crude oil spills on amphibian diversity (2024)  
- BirdCLEF+ 2025: multi-taxonomic sound identification in Colombia
