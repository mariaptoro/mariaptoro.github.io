# About

I am a Colombian biologist with a strong interest in biodiversity research, bioacoustics, and the ecology and evolution of amphibians and reptiles. I obtained my B.Sc. in Biology from the Universidad del Quindío in 2022. My undergraduate thesis explored the evolutionary relationship between parental care and warning coloration in poison frogs (Dendrobatidae).

Since then, I have developed my research career around Neotropical biodiversity, combining fieldwork, biological collections, and acoustic data analysis. I am currently a researcher at the Biological Collections and Species Management Centre of the Alexander von Humboldt Institute, where I work with environmental sound collections and biodiversity data.

Beyond research, I am actively involved in science communication, outreach, and academic mentoring. I strongly believe in making scientific knowledge accessible and in supporting scientific vocations among young students.
