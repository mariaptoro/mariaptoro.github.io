# Maria Paula Toro-Gómez

Biologist researcher at the Humboldt Institute (IAvH). I work at the intersection of bioacoustics, biodiversity monitoring, and amphibian ecology.

I’m Maria Paula, a biologist and researcher at the [Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute](http://www.humboldt.org.co/es) (IAvH), where I work at the Biological Collections and Species Management Centre, specifically with the Environmental Sound Collection.

My research interests span behavioral and evolutionary ecology, biodiversity monitoring, climate change, and anthropogenic impacts, using amphibians and bioacoustics as a study system. I am particularly interested in passive acoustic monitoring and the development of ecological datasets that support biodiversity assessment and conservation in the Neotropics. My work integrates field ecology, biological collections, and acoustic data analysis, often in interdisciplinary and collaborative contexts.

Currently, I am involved in creating and curating datasets based on passive acoustic monitoring of multiple taxonomic groups, contributing tools for large-scale biodiversity monitoring and conservation planning.

Previously, I was a junior researcher in the [Orquídeas – Science for Peace Program](https://programaorquideas.minciencias.gov.co/) of the Colombian Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. This program supports women in science and focuses on identifying structural causes of violence in Colombia. Through this project, I worked on amphibian monitoring in collaboration with Awá Indigenous communities in the southeastern Colombian Pacific, combining ecological research with community-based conservation approaches.

I obtained my undergraduate degree in Biology from the [Universidad del Quindío](https://www.uniquindio.edu.co/), where I was part of the [EECO research group](https://www.fvargas-eeco.org/). My undergraduate thesis explored the relationship between parental care and antipredator strategies, specifically aposematic coloration, in poison frogs (Dendrobatidae).

## Research interests

Ecology and biodiversity monitoring have a strong and growing relationship with machine learning. On one hand, machine learning provides novel tools to process, extract, and analyze complex ecological data. On the other hand, ecological systems offer challenging and rich environments for exploring the foundations of machine learning due to their scale, complexity, and variability.

My research interests include challenges such as domain shift, spatiotemporal correlations, fine-grained acoustic classification, learning across data modalities, self-supervised learning, and long-tailed distributions. I am also deeply interested in collaborative research with local communities to co-create conservation tools that generate tangible impacts on biodiversity conservation.
