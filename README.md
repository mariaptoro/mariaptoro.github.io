### About me

<p class="justificado">I’m Maria Paula, a biologist researcher at the Humboldt Institute in Colombia (IAvH). My research interests span the fields of behavioral and evolutionary ecology, biodiversity monitoring, climate change, and anthropogenic impact, using bioacoustics and amphibians as a study group. Currently, I’m working on creating datasets based on passive acoustic monitoring  of different taxonomic groups to provide tools for monitoring the Neotropics.

Previously, I was a junior researcher in the Orchids program of the Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia, this program is dedicated to women in science, to develop projects that identify the causes of Violence in Colombia, through this project I was involved in monitoring amphibians with Awá Indigenous communities at the southeast of Colombian pacific. My undergraduate studies were at the University of Quindio in the EECO group, of the Biology Program where I worked on the relationship between parental care and antipredator strategies such as aposematism in poison frogs.</p>

I am also part of the Ecoacoustics Colombian Network (Red Ecoacústica Colombiana - REC)
